# Corporate Chaos

> **Beta Testing Notice:** This project is currently in beta testing. Features and mechanics may change, and there is no official instruction manual yet. Early testers have been briefed on the gameplay mechanics. Please expect updates and improvements in future releases.

Corporate Chaos is a turn-based business management simulation designed to gamify the experience of running a company. Its initial goal is to allow users to **simulate business management and supervision** in a fun yet analytical way, while also providing insight into different approaches people take when managing a business.  

## Features

- **Turn-Based System:** Each decision and action is processed in turns, allowing strategic planning and thoughtful management.  
- **Comprehensive Management:** Users can manage nearly all aspects of a business, from operations to finance, marketing, and human resources.  
- **Chaotic Event Tree:** Random events occur throughout the game, influenced by three core stats. This introduces unpredictability and challenges players to adapt.  
- **Game Statistics:** At the end of each run, detailed statistics summarize the performance, decisions, and outcomes.  

## Intention

The original intention of Corporate Chaos was to serve as a simulation for collecting data on **business practices and decision-making approaches** from different users. Over time, it has also become a small-scale game, enjoyed by testers and myself, blending both **analytics and entertainment**.
